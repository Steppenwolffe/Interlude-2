It was rainy and I was planning to go into proper water. Because i was into the game. The game was inpart to stay warm, in part to believe that fantasy in life could be realized and in part to finish my assignment. Nyuyen said that we could gamify life and i was going to run home with this. well walk. After swimming. after a sandwich.  Nuyen brings up an interesting concept that calls us to ask some existential questions about disposabale ends.  What is interesting about disposable ends is that it entails we can attain them in the first place. So how could we use the Historical Problem Space framework to design a space where we could expand the disambiguation. 


So i was on wikipedia, and i wanted to make some of the philosophies available that I thought would help people get through the hard part of life. I wanted to try to build my own knowledge network of how you could care and attain a disposable end. 
Disposibile ends is a motivtional inversion that challanges whether we need to care deeply about the means to engage in fulfilling play experince.
For example, if I want to go swimming, The means of doing it could be singular or several. The idea here would be not to ask if the swimming is motivational, but rather, do I find enjoyment and engagement in the means of getting to the swimming bit.

struggling to care about the means of the assignment despite having motivation for 

Can I appropriate elements of the game I am good at playing (enjoy playing) into the games that I am not motivated to complete. 

1. games i like(gameworld, obstacle, player, agents, tools, ) poetry, socialisin, swimming(), 

2. games i want to learn(gameworld, player )
(historical games for class/ assignment)

3. To find commonalities and differences, and to measure the degree of difference and alos explore ways to bridge those gaps. commonalities between elemnts or map the distance(delta) ie. stay dry in the rain and get wet in the pool. 
4. commonalityis to get wet. 
5. HPS framework, cookies with nuyen how t
6. draw it! assignment gamespace, miami game space, my games gamespace. 
7. Leanr and delve into the beauty seen through other eyes (geller). to appreciate the parts of the game(_ _)
8. test hypothesis where is similar where different. 


go from age of empires to 1987 miami!!! (missions) 

record tonight in terms of collab. ( )


I was struggling to start from where others had start but i was motivvated by where i was. i had friends and ideas and some drawings. great. I was going to name this starting point gravis fuga which was latin for heavy flight. but wikipedia was no bueno. but my response was intriguing caus eit was nt an error or a no it was this is  a disamibiguation of what exist. 


so then i wanted to create a comic that would use the "error messages" of writting an article in wikipedia to tell us and illustrate to others when you have reache d aproblem what you might be doing wrong. To describe the gap between the mapping of what exist and your visions. 

Closign the canyon. 

as we wentthrough different text on play i realized that we get closer to creating play when we engage in understanding new places to explore. hence i relaly want to leave the counrty asap. [[story for another day]] but the hardest part of helping anyone close the canyon between their demons and reality that is ready to hold their hand is to translate there unrelaized wikipedia page to the closest starting point and to be able to do this we need a way to input the none sense to the world that is the dull sense of the being into a listning room. 

to prove all this is true observe that gravis fuga which means hevay flight returns this from gooogle. 


''Whoever is sick at heart and hopes that he can alleviate the hateful torment [lit. the hatefulness of the torment] by travelling and running over the sea: he is not unlike this Stag. For he carries around in his soul both the pain of the wound [lit. the wound of sickness] and the means of alleviating it, [p.139] and in throwing himself upon the kindness of strangers, if he is badly treated, he grows weary, and adds to the bitterness of the wound.

Read game design in imperial mode

I thought about pace as  away to design games differently. I like this idea becuase i was just thinking about how it would be cool to design a game that captures for example training as a roman athlete form the perspective of starting out as a peasant where not only do you need to train but find someone who belive in you to trian you make time for you rlow paying jo to train make enough money that you can eta and battle systemoic barriers of people assming you will come to nothing becaue tuyou are a peaseant. 

how this hero journey relates back to trying to make it in life and how it could be a worthy lesosn and endeavoutr. maybe even the more you help others a long the wya the more you get rewarded. the more you do with ess resources, the stronger your skills become in the future of the game. i think this would be a neat way to use the affordances of the game to ressemble and capture struggle for what jayanth is trying to talk about and do herlsef. expect in this case it would be reflecting some socioeconomic battle. 


key take away's 

- flow states that encourage people to continue playing and neglect helath are pervasieve reminds me off nudging culture and persuasive deisgn. some how it even reminfds me of planned obselescene 
- there are risks associated with brekaing the bounds of narratives espcially in the example game of thirty exes where the white protagonist is invited to a home unfamilar to them 
- progress and pace are good starting points as to where we can go from where we find ourselves in the timeline of pushing against the bounds of games. 
game deisgn philosophy 


After reading Jayanth's paper I watched some videos a friend had suggested of people reviewing games. One in particular was looking at and criticizing the game design philosophies used to make a game. They were noticing that there was more challenge. 

I looked at the example in Jayanth's paper of the video game she was working on and I was floored. This game was the most epic thing I'd ever seen and I'd just watch a bunch of reviews of some of the most popular and mainstream games being played. So 
-


My intial idea of wanting to gamify things in life wasn't completely lost. 
but i wanted to do something better. I was really inspired by how the game transfrmed the same game elements I thought were so boring in other games and applied it and used witty dialogue and layered this bad ass character relative to her experience. 


A while ago I was listneing to a podcast about the wright brothers. The podcast was describing their friendly banter that was pivotal to there engineering success. To banter and challenge one another's thoughts. Another example was steve jobs which was also brought up in the remixed video which was interesting.  
Anyway, this story of how theses brothers would banter stuck with me becuase( ) I felt how challenging this could be for people. 

(it's hard to challenge your thinking while reachign a goal. )

So I thought what if I could train an Ai to be like the wrigth brothers in there stubborn bantering. So your mission is to build a plan let's say but the game design obstacles and tools would be to work with the well respected wright brother engineers. I wasn't sure if there was enough documentation or whta the documentation looked like. SO I looked it up and sure enough there was careful documentatio of letters back and forth, journals, conversations. 

Could I simulate the interpersonal resilience needed to successfully build something from the source material of engineers in history who 


So i'm sitting here at a cafe and these gentlemen are discussing copyright and ownership between music that i just finished listenign to from the video. 

Boy is the white protagonish pervasive. 

This is ultimately my response to the question of how to play history. Nyuen's work made me reflect on many things 

first 

Nguyen discussing striving play in light of achievement play. Striving play they argue, allows us to adopt alternative agencies for aesthetic reasons. Nguyen builds on this argument from Suits work on disposable ends. Stiving play then, "...involves an inverted motivational state where we take on ends for the sake of the means they force us through". That, "agency can be modertely fluid". I reflecte don this in light of thesis work I did on designing for behaviour change. To play around with motivation and disseminate the contruction of play in a matrix of extinsic verses intrinsic play ignited hope in  being able to finish my assignment. It also nuclearly inspred me to think of all the ways making games could teach skills and instill confidence. I started to think of all the different ways we could make the games we play better and more fun. More playfull. 

So I experiemented with the idea of exploring some games I like becuase I don't actually play or know a lot of games but I relaly adore GTA. And some games in life that I'm good at and some I'm not. I like to go swimming but swimming involves a lot more for me than just jumping in the water. So I tried to use the historical Problem Space Framework to msp the journey.  The I would try to do the same thing with GTA  Vice City set in the 80's. For this I watched game play and used some oonline sources to fill in the parts of the framework. 

What I was curious to explore is perhaps what was playful in both situations and what wasn't. 

I have a friend in Human Centered Design at Algonquin who helped me articulate this through discussion and pointed out how Miami Vice takes place in t=history of the 80's. He also showed me some videos of people reviewing games and some documentatiews on games like doom. 

I feel Belanger brakes rigidity and comparmentalization of the way we conceptualize games. Specifically the concept of assemblages takes our way of seeing games from belonging to the prefontal cortex to the neural networks that get activated across the span of the brain when we problem solve.  So we can expand the limits of what we imagine when we put pointer to program. To combine this with with Suitsian concepts of taking on obstacles voluntarily. In Nyuen words, "we can play games as evidence that we are capable of transcending rationality".Come back to a world of plentitude. As discussed int eh cyborg paper. 

Brief Intermission: while I was tlakign to my friend I thought of writting a wkipedia page and then I would try to connect it wth other concepts that exist and connect in wikipedia through hyperlinks. I wanted to have an island in the many main lands of the internet. And the name i would give it would be Gravis Fuga. I gave it this name becuase i was feelig heavy and excited to complete my assignment. I was reflecting on the material that was  airy and light but complex, laden and requiring tenacity. Gravis - menaing heavy in latin and Fuga meaning flight. 

two things happened: 

I found a story about a dear written by a poet from a long time ago emulating the exact sentiment I was feeling. Holly cow! Cool. 
"pain on one hand and flight on the other is harsh". Sure is. 

Secondly I got this page from wikipedia which tripped me out. 
![[Screen Shot 2022-11-11 at 6.21.42 PM.png]]

First of all wikipedia is giving me some serious backlash and telling me i can't just enter the netweork with something insanely amibigous. Fair point. This requires more research but I read carefully through the message and realized yeh. Starying from where you are and trying to enter the organized world is diffficult and requires effort, translating, and a whole bunch of other knw how i have yet to leanr. 

but back to the assignment. 

Jayanth's game thirsty suitors filled me with the same excitment as Morgan's cyborg paper. Both of these texts incited more questions. One discussing beautiful, sensous and expansive idea sof how we can reconceptualize and digest the tools around us to come back to the original menaing of why we are doing it in the first palce as articulated in the remix youtube video. The other calling us to be conscentious inside the game developing world and the forces at play. Jayanth's paper left me very Gravis.   but insanely curous and perhaps left me feeling inclined. 

Between the two papers was curiosity, questions, tools, ideas, practices, awarness that I was excited to cross but would take time and resilence, persaverance, tenacity and fuga. Flighht. 

I needed to finish my assignment. 

Finally flight. :the Wright Brothers. 




Final words: 

In the spirit of breaking the rules and pushing boundries, I will quote a quote. 

mature historical thought rest in our ability to navigate the uneven landscape of history, to traverse terrain that lies between poles of familiarity with the distance from the past  

Kelley concludes with calling us to travel, "the jagged edge of history" towards embracing the remix towards different notions of history and new notions of authenticity. The urgency and significance of Janath's work. The ways the historicla pProblem Space Framework by Mcal challenges us in how we thnk of games. The ways morgan's cyborg paper calls us back to humanistic technological creation. The underlying innocence of good play in Nguyen's discussion of stiving. And the fringe examples emerging today echoing this essence makes playful enagement ready for lift off. 

Here is to taking flight!
