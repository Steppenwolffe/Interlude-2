## Success 

### Asking for helping and discussing ideas 
In part forced in part voluntary but I really see how ideas are mobilized a lot quicker if you talk to others and ask questions about what you don't know. I asked Keegan in class questions about games he knew as I came up woth differnt ideas of what I was interested in doing. This helped me research and evolve my ideas with a faster turn over rate. 

Saket a friend from Human Centered Design at Algonquin also helped me suss out some of my ideas and gave me tips on videos to watch to familiarize yself with the dissemination of some ideas. 

### Experimenting with the framework 

I played around with using the framework beyond just games. I found even Undertsanidng how it is applied and seeing soem themes implicity throughout my exploration of games made it simpel to undertand and create organization in thinking about games. 

### Finding a motivating starting point. 
The more I got to know different tools the easier it was to know which one to pick practising. I did quiet a bit of research looking at instructional videos for Open Ai and although I was really  interested in using the tool I found the Bitsy interface more drawerly and simple to engage with. 



## Failure 

### Spending time making  mistakes
It's a gear shift to work where you can end up with nothing or exploration does resilt in whst you would expect. Many of the tools are super exciting and it's overwhelming all the possibilities of what can be done with the tools. This made it hard to start anywhere. Or I would end up watching a bunch of videos on what to do and actually overcomplicate the task entirely. 

### Doing more than thinking 

I defeintely get analysis paralysis. The more I thought about my project the more complicated it became the harder it was to try to create something and then I would freeze up.  In part I think I need to strategize a simple task.  In other part just go out there and make mistakes. 


## Moving Forward 

1. spend time getting to know and explore different tools, then choose a tool I'd like to use to get started with. 
2. Bounce between doing and thinking more. Maybe even for the sake of what I know about myself I will aspire to do more than research or think. 
3. Discuss preliminary ideas with classmates and colllegues sooner. Utilize discord more. 
4. Be more diligent with documentation along the way. The more I tried to clumsily figure out using tools the more
